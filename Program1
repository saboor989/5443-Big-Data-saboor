Converting  .csv File format to .json file format

Why .csv?

The .csv file format i believe to be the simplest of all , where data is in comma separated instead of Curly braces or
 square brackets etc...
 The csv file is simple ,supported by almost all spreadsheets and database management systems. 
 Many programming languages have libraries available that support CSV files.
 Many implementations projects support changing the field-separator character and some quoting conventions,
 although it is a safe and simplest  conventions, to increase or maximize the recipient's or users
 chances of handling the data.
